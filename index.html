        <h2>Class 1 Summary</h2>
            <p>
            In my first HTML class, I learned about the basic structure of an HTML document and how to work with Visual Studio for coding. Here's a summary of what I covered:
        
            <h3>1. HTML Structure:</h3>
            Every HTML document has a basic structure that includes key tags like &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. These elements define how the document is organized.
            
            <h3>2. Title:</h3>
            The title tag is placed inside the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document and defines the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.

            <h3>3. Head Tag:</h3>
            The head tag contains metadata like the title, links to stylesheets, and scripts.

            <h3>4. Body:</h3>
            The "body" tag contains all the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.

            <h3>5. Using Visual Studio:</h3>
            I learned how to use Visual Studio as an editor for writing HTML code. I now know how to open a folder, create an HTML file, and start writing code within it

            <h3>6. Adding Images:</h3>
            I also learned how to add images to a webpage using the "img" tag. The tag requires the src attribute to specify the image's location and the alt attribute to describe the image in case it doesn't load.
